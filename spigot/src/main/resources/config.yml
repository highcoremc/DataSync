# How the plugin should store data
#
# - Possible options:
#
#   |  Remote databases - require connection information to be configured below
#   |=> MySQL
#   |=> MariaDB (preferred over MySQL)
#   |=> PostgreSQL
#   |=> Redis
#
# - A PostgreSQL database is the default option.
storage-method: PotgreSQL

# The following block defines the settings for remote database storage methods.
#
data:

  # Define the address and port for the database.
  # - The standard DB engine port is used by default
  #   (MySQL: 3306, PostgreSQL: 5432, Redis: 6379)
  # - Specify as "host:port" if differs
  address: localhost

  # The name of the database to store NoDataSync data in.
  # - This must be created already. Don't worry about this setting if you're using MongoDB.
  database: minecraft # ignored for type Redis

  # Credentials for the database.
  username: root # ignored for type Redis
  password: ''

  # These settings apply to the MySQL connection pool.
  # - The default values will be suitable for the majority of users.
  # - Do not change these settings unless you know what you're doing!
  pool-settings:

    # Sets the maximum size of the MySQL connection pool.
    # - Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual
    #   connections to the database backend.
    # - More information about determining the size of connection pools can be found here:
    #   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
    maximum-pool-size: 10

    # Sets the minimum number of idle connections that the pool will try to maintain.
    # - For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, it is recommended to not set
    #   this value and instead allow the pool to act as a fixed size connection pool.
    #   (set this value to the same as 'maximum-pool-size')
    minimum-idle: 10

    # This setting controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool in milliseconds.
    # - The value should be at least 30 seconds less than any database or infrastructure imposed
    #   connection time limit.
    maximum-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes

    # This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds that the plugin will wait for a
    # connection from the pool, before timing out.
    connection-timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds

    # This setting allows you to define extra properties for connections.
    #
    # By default, the following options are set to enable utf8 encoding. (you may need to remove
    # these if you are using PostgreSQL)
    #   useUnicode: true
    #   characterEncoding: utf8
    #
    # You can also use this section to disable SSL connections, by uncommenting the 'useSSL' and
    # 'verifyServerCertificate' options below.
    properties:
      useUnicode: true
      characterEncoding: utf8
      #useSSL: false
      #verifyServerCertificate: false

  # The prefix for all NoDataSync SQL tables.
  # - Change this if you want to use different tables for different servers.
